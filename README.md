# FAQ

### Question 1: What's the purpose of this Asset Pack?

A: Inspired by [SCHUD](https://github.com/FliiFe/schud), I've decided to release the entire asset pack for those who would like to use it. 

While all of the images were specifically repurposed for Controller Overlays, I believe it can be used for various things. like a custom skin for VSCView, for a Community Modding Project, an website or maybe part of a mod of a existing video game!


### Question 2: What does pack this include?

A: Simply put: it includes the complete Controller Overlays created for VSCView (after [Version 0.5.0.0 release](https://github.com/Nielk1/VSCView/releases/tag/v0.5.0.0)), the Icons, the Images and even leftovers that haven't been deleted *yet*. This includes WIP, Unreleased and Unfinished images. 

In addition: certain themes contains alternative versions within the same SVG file, for example: The **Xbox One Wireless Controller Theme** allows you to swap between the Launch Model or the Xbox One S-onwards model.

For Generic Themes specifically designed for modularity, such as **Arcade Controller Theme**: you can swap between Button Prompt styles and Input Styles.

### Question 3: Which Image Editor, File Format and Fonts was used for this asset pack?

This asset pack was created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). 

All images formats are Inkscape SVG, PNGs and XCF. For Image Editing: I recommend Inkscape for the best experience.

[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font family used for certain themes (such as the Compact theme for Steam Controller, Steam Deck and Arcade Controller)

The PlayStation 20th Anniversary Touchpad Symbols was [created by GT Planet forums user Maninashed](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/gt-sport-svg-request-thread-please-read-1st-post.367463/page-89#post-12340218).

# Guideline

### Question 1: Can I use this Asset Pack for my personal or community-driven projects? (i.e Gamepad overlay, custom image, mods, reverse engineered project, fan project)

As long as you credit this project (as per [MIT License](https://github.com/AL2009man/Gamepad-Overlay-Asset-Pack/blob/main/LICENSE)), sure.


### Question 2: Can I use this Asset Pack for my commercially released game/planned to be released commercially? (i.e: releasing on Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, Microsoft/Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, etc.) 

For that purpose: **I do not recommend using this asset pack**. The vast majority of the assets are ripped straight from the official source or recreated by scratch. The official source images has also been modified for the primary purpose of Controller Overlays programs (and many others). There's a likely chance that you might fail the platform holder's certification in the process.

Thus: I highly suggest grabbing the assets packs provided by the platform holders, an Third party asset pack that has a public domain license or make one yourself.
