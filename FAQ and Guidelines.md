Question

Question 1: Can I use your Asset Pack my project? (i.e Gamepad overlay, custom image, mods, reverse engineered project, free game)

As long as you credit this project (as per license), sure.

Question 2: Can I use your Asset Pack for my game to be released commercially? (i.e: releasing on Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, Microsoft/Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, etc.) 

A2: I strongly recommend against the use of this asset pack. The vast majority of the assets are ripped straight from the official source and has been modified for the primary purpose of Controller Overlays (and many others). You're better off grabbing the assets provided by the platform holders, an 3rd party asset pack that has a public domain license or make one yourself.

Question 3: Which Image Editor did you use?

This asset pack was created using Inkscape and GIMP and I suggest using Inkscape for layers organization.
