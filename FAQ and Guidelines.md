Question

Question 1: Can I use your Asset Pack for my project? (i.e Gamepad overlay, custom image, mods, reverse engineered project, fan project)

As long as you credit this project (as per license), sure.


Question 2: Can I use your Asset Pack for my commercially released game/planned to be released commercially? (i.e: releasing on Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, Microsoft/Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, etc.) 

I do not recommend using this asset pack. The vast majority of the assets are ripped straight from the official source and has been modified for the primary purpose of Controller Overlays (and many others). There's a likely chance that you might fail the platform holder's certification in the process.

Thus: I highly suggest grabbing the assets packs provided by the platform holders, an 3rd party asset pack that has a public domain license or make one yourself.


Question 3: Which Image Editor did you use?

This asset pack was created using Inkscape and GIMP. For Image Editing: I recommend Inkscape for the best experience.
