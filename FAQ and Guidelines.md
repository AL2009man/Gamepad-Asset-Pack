# FAQ

## Question 1: What's the purpose of this Asset Pack?

A: As stated in the README.md, this pack is meant for those who would like to get access to all the Controller-related assets. Inspired by https://github.com/FliiFe/schud, I've decided to release the entire asset pack for those who would like to use it.

While all of the images were specifically repurposed for Controller Overlays, I believe it can be used for various things. like a custom skin for VSCView, for a Community Modding Project, an website or maybe part of a mod of a existing video game! For more info; please refer to Guidelines section.


## Question 2: What does pack this include?

A: Simply put: it includes the complete Controller Overlays created for VSCView (after V. 0.5.0.0 release), the Icons, the Images and even leftovers that haven't been deleted yet. 

This includes WIP, Unreleased and Unfinished images.


## Question 3: Which Image Editor, File Format and Fonts was used for this asset pack?

This asset pack was created using Inkscape and GIMP. 

All images are .svg and .png formats. I don't exactly remember the Fonts that was used (for some SVGs) for this pack, but you might need to download the equivalent font elsewhere on the Internet if asked.

For Image Editing: I recommend Inkscape for the best experience.




#Guideline

## Question 1: Can I use this Asset Pack for my personal or community-driven projects? (i.e Gamepad overlay, custom image, mods, reverse engineered project, fan project)

As long as you credit this project (as per MIT License), sure.


## Question 2: Can I use this Asset Pack for my commercially released game/planned to be released commercially? (i.e: releasing on Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, Microsoft/Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, etc.) 

For that purpose: **I do not recommend using this asset pack**. The vast majority of the assets are ripped straight from the official source or recreated by scratch. The official source images has also been modified for the primary purpose of Controller Overlays programs (and many others). There's a likely chance that you might fail the platform holder's certification in the process.

Thus: I highly suggest grabbing the assets packs provided by the platform holders, an Third party asset pack that has a public domain license or make one yourself.
